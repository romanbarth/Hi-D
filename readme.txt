Execute the file HiD.m to process an example of a U2OS nucleus labeled by DNA-SiR. 
The processed file can be easily changed by setting the appropriate directory (full 
path including filename and extension). 

The example data takes ~2h 20 min on following system:
      Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700IQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz 2.60 Ghz
      16.0 Gb RAM
