The software is provided "as is" as a set of MATLAB resource files and is 
tested under MATLAB version 7.5 (R2017b).
If you use this code or parts of it in your research, please refer to our publication.

Required toolboxes:

- Image Processing Toolbox

- Optimization Toolbox (for Bayesian model selection)
- Statistics Toolbox (for Bayesian model selection)

Execute the file HiD.m to process an example of a U2OS nucleus labeled by DNA-SiR. 
The processed file can be easily changed by setting the appropriate directory (full 
path including filename and extension). 

The example data takes ~2h 20 min on following system:
      Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700IQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz 2.60 Ghz
      16.0 Gb RAM
